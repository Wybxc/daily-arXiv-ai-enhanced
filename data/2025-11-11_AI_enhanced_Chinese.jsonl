In this context, we focus on fully automatic code optimization techniques that automate the process of selecting and applying code transformations for better performance without manual intervention. Understanding how these transformations behave and interact is key to designing more effective optimization strategies. Compiler developers must make numerous design choices when constructing these heuristics. For instance, they may decide whether to allow transformations to be explored in any arbitrary order or to enforce a fixed sequence. While the former may theoretically offer the best performance gains, it significantly increases the search space. This raises an important question: Can a predefined, fixed order of applying transformations speed up the search without severely compromising optimization potential? In this paper, we address this and other related questions that arise in the design of automatic code optimization algorithms. Using a data-driven approach, we generate a large dataset of random programs, apply random optimization sequences, and record their execution times. Through statistical analysis, we provide insights that guide the development of more efficient automatic code optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u56fa\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u800c\u4e0d\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u53d8\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u8fd8\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u524d\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u56fa\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53d8\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5FANDANGO-RS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRust\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e863-4\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRust\u7c7b\u578b\u548ctrait\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba9\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "FANDANGO-RS\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u4e863-4\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u751f\u6210401\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684C\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7f\u5f97FANDANGO-RS\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5148\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Refinement, which verifies that an implementation preserves certain properties of a more abstract specification, is promising for tackling such challenges. However, in terms of refinement-based verification of security properties, existing techniques are still restricted to sequential systems or lack the expressiveness needed to capture complex security policies for concurrent systems.\n  In this work, we present a generalized security-preserving refinement technique, particularly for verifying the IFS of concurrent systems governed by potentially complex security policies. We formalize the IFS properties for concurrent systems and present a refinement-based compositional approach to prove that the generalized security properties (e.g., intransitive noninterference) are preserved between implementation and abstraction. The key intuition enabling such reasoning, compared to previous refinement work, is to establish a step-mapping relation between the implementation and the abstraction, which is sufficient to ensure that every paired step (in the abstraction and the implementation, respectively) is either permitted or prohibited by the security policy. We apply our approach to verify two non-trivial case studies against a collection of security policies. Our proofs are fully mechanized in Isabelle/HOL, during which we identified that two covert channels previously reported in the ARINC 653 single-core standard also exist in the ARINC 653 multicore standard.

Akshay", "Ashutosh Gupta"], "title": "Verifying rich robustness properties for neural networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Robustness is a important problem in AI alignment and safety, with models such as neural networks being increasingly used in safety-critical systems. In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e., checking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized encoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify variants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a specification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to capture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of robustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its outputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all such variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while incurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having 138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a wide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u8303\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5c42\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7f16\u7801\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u8003\u8651\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u57288870\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u6700\u5927\u7f51\u7edc1.38\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8003\u8651\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite the demonstrated success of previous Web API recommendation solutions, two critical challenges persist: 1) a fixed top-N recommendation that cannot accommodate the varying API cardinality requirements of different mashups, and 2) these methods output only ranked API lists without accompanying reasons, depriving users of understanding the recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification. WAR-Re leverages special start and stop tokens to handle the first challenge and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the model's ability in both tasks. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WAR-Re achieves a gain of up to 21.59\\% over the state-of-the-art baseline model in recommendation accuracy, while consistently producing high-quality semantic reasons for recommendations.", "AI": {"tldr": "WAR-Re\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684Web API\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540cmashup\u7684API\u6570\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Web API\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1)\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684top-N\u63a8\u8350\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540cmashup\u7684API\u6570\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2)\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u8f93\u51fa\u6392\u540d\u5217\u8868\u800c\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u8350\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u6b8a\u5f00\u59cb\u548c\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u7406\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ProgrammableWeb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWAR-Re\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe21.59%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "WAR-Re\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Web API\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of labeled logs. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from mature systems to train an anomaly detection model of a target system based on the idea of transfer learning. However, these works still require a certain number of labeled logs from the target system. In this paper, we take a step forward and study a valuable yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection, that is, no labeled logs are available in the target system. Specifically, we propose ZeroLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that enables cross-system log-based anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. To achieve this, we leverage unsupervised domain adaptation to perform adversarial training between the source and target domains, aiming to learn system-agnostic general feature representations. By employing meta-learning, the learned representations are further generalized to the target system without any target labels.

State-of-the-art approaches perform well with a few labeled target logs, but limitations remain: small-model methods transfer general knowledge but overlook mismatches with the target system's proprietary knowledge; LLM-based methods can capture proprietary patterns but rely on a few positive examples and incur high inference cost. Existing LLM-small model collaborations route 'simple logs' to the small model and 'complex logs' to the LLM based on output uncertainty. In zero-label cross-system settings, supervised sample complexity is unavailable, and such routing does not consider knowledge separation. To address this, we propose GeneralLog, a novel LLM-small model collaborative method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection. GeneralLog dynamically routes unlabeled logs, letting the LLM handle 'proprietary logs' and the small model 'general logs,' enabling cross-system generalization without labeled target logs.

However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \\textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance.

However, researchers and practitioners may have a hard time locating consolidated evidence on this impact, as the available information is scattered in several different publications. Our goal is to aggregate consolidated findings on quality in MDE, facilitating the work of researchers and practitioners in learning about the coverage and main findings of existing work as well as identifying relatively unexplored niches of research that need further attention. We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute). We briefly outline the main contributions of each of the selected literature reviews. In the collected studies, we observed a broad coverage of software product quality, although frequently accompanied by notes on how much more empirical research is needed to further validate existing claims. Relatively, little attention seems to be devoted to the impact of MDE on the quality in use of products developed using MDE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b(MDE)\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u662fMDE\u6700\u5e38\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u6620\u5c04\u578b\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "MDE\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6c47\u603bMDE\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e86\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MDE\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8622\u7bc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u662fMDE\u6700\u5e38\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u300283\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u670980\u4e2a\u662f\u6620\u5c04\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6bd4\u8f83\u5177\u4f53MDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u666e\u904d\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002", "conclusion": "MDE\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u4e0a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u6620\u5c04\u578b\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9MDE\u5f00\u53d1\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002"}}

Published at ECSA 2025 Tracks and Workshops", "summary": "The global production of electric goods is at an all-time high, causing negative environmental and health impacts as well as a continuing depletion of natural resources. Considering the worsening global climate change, a transition of current industrial processes is necessary to tackle the above-mentioned factors. To address this urgent issue, socio-economic systems like the Circular Economy (CE) provide options to reallocate the use of resources and products on a global scale. Especially in terms of product lifecycle-prolonging, this system provides suitable approaches to alter the current modes of product handling by society and industry alike, based on the condition of the products. Although the importance and benefits of sustainable services enabling these options are widely known, users tend to shy away from using them. One of the reasons is the missing reliability in terms of the knowledge of the costs associated with a particular service. This uncertainty in expected pricing can, therefore, lower the willingness of potential clients. However, not only clients struggle with the boundary conditions of such services. On the part of the potential providers of services, the monetary risk is often caused by the incapability to detect the condition of a product in advance. This can result on the provider side in a severe economic loss if this possibility is not covered by the service price or through the mass of items, which could allow equalization of serval service operations. To address these weak points in current service execution, the authors propose the \\textit{Lifecycle Workbench (LCW)}-ecosystem, which features digital representations to enhance the reliability of service pricing as well as the assessment of the condition of items, assemblies, and parts in the Circular Economy domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u670d\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u8fbe\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u9762\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u6301\u7eed\u67af\u7aed\u3002\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5168\u7403\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u56de\u907f\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e5f\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7ecf\u6d4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7269\u54c1\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u670d\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bdLCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

This study conducts an empirical analysis of 200 open-source Android projects written in Java and Kotlin to diagnose and resolve build failures. Through a five-phase process encompassing data collection, build execution, failure classification, repair strategy design, and LLM-assisted evaluation, we identified four primary types of build errors: environment issues, dependency and Gradle task errors, configuration problems, and syntax/API incompatibilities. Among the 135 projects that initially failed to build, our diagnostic and repair strategy enabled developers to resolve 102 cases (75.56%), significantly reducing troubleshooting effort. We further examined the potential of Large Language Models, such as GPT-5, to assist in error diagnosis, achieving a 53.3% success rate in suggesting viable fixes. An analysis of project attributes revealed that build success is influenced by programming language, project age, and app size.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) automate UI-to-Code generation, they generate only static HTML/CSS/JavaScript layouts lacking interactivity. To address this, we propose WebVIA, the first agentic framework for interactive UI-to-Code generation and validation. The framework comprises three components: 1) an exploration agent to capture multi-state UI screenshots; 2) a UI2Code model that generates executable interactive code; 3) a validation module that verifies the interactivity. Experiments demonstrate that WebVIA-Agent achieves more stable and accurate UI exploration than general-purpose agents (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro).

These discussions contain proposed solutions-from design changes to code implementations-as well as their evaluations. Locating solution-related content is essential for investigating reopened issues, addressing regressions, reusing solutions, and understanding code change rationale. Manually understanding long discussions to identify such content can be difficult and time-consuming.\n  This paper automates solution identification using language models as supervised classifiers. We investigate three applications-embeddings, prompting, and fine-tuning-across three classifier types: traditional ML models (MLMs), pre-trained language models (PLMs), and large language models (LLMs). Using 356 Mozilla Firefox issues, we created a dataset to train and evaluate six MLMs, four PLMs, and two LLMs across 68 configurations.\n  Results show that MLMs with LLM embeddings outperform TF-IDF features, prompting underperforms, and fine-tuned LLMs achieve the highest performance, with LLAMAft reaching 0.716 F1 score.

We report an empirical study of both open-source and closed-source LLMs of varying sizes to assess their proficiency in inferring inductive loop invariants for programs and in fixing incorrect invariants.

Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering.

The use of outdated OSS libraries introduces technical lag, necessitating timely upgrades. However, maintaining up-to-date libraries is challenging, as it may introduce incompatibility issues that break the project or redundant dependencies that unnecessarily increase the size of the project. These issues discourage developers from upgrading libraries, highlighting the need for a fully automated solution that balances version upgrades, reduces technical lag, ensures compatibility, and avoids redundant dependencies.\n  To this end, we propose DepUpdater, which ensures that upgrades minimize technical lag as much as possible while avoiding incompatibility issues and redundant dependencies. The comparison with existing dependency management tools demonstrates that DepUpdater more effectively reduces technical lag while ensuring compatibility and pruning redundant dependencies.

Data is often siloed across numerous disparate tools, making manual report generation time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a centralized framework designed to provide near-real-time visibility into developer experience (DevEx) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics for a software ecosystem. By aggregating data from various internal tools and platforms, the system computes and visualizes metrics across key areas such as Developer Productivity, Quality, and Operational Efficiency. The architecture features a cron-based data ingestion layer, a dual-schema data storage approach, a processing engine for metric pre-computation, a proactive alerting system, and utilizes the open-source BI tool Metabase for visualization, all secured with role-based access control (RBAC). The implementation resulted in a significant reduction in manual reporting efforts, saving an estimated 20 person-hours per week, and enabled faster, data-driven bottleneck identification. Finally, we evaluate the system's scalability and discuss its trade-offs, positioning it as a valuable contribution to engineering intelligence platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u5404\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u548cKPI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u83b7\u53d6\u56e2\u961f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5065\u5eb7\u6574\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5206\u6563\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8ecron\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6444\u53d6\u5c42\u3001\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6307\u6807\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90BI\u5de5\u5177Metabase\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u90fd\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u540e\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u8282\u7701\u7ea620\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u74f6\u9888\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5de5\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

However, this is not always the case because of delays arising from limited skilled manpower and health information management systems that are neither integrated nor organized in their design hence leading to information gap among care groups. Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management. We however notice some similarities between cancer treatment and software engineering information management especially when progress history needs to be maintained (versioning).\n  We analyze the similarities and propose a model for information sharing among cancer care groups using the software engineering principles approach. We model for reducing delays and improving coordination among care groups in cancer case management. Model design was guided by software engineering principles adopted in GitHub version control system for bug fixing in open-source code projects. Any-Logic simulation software was used to mimic the model realism in a virtual environment. Results show that bug resolution principles from software engineering and GitHub version control system can be adopted to coordinate collaboration and information sharing among care groups in a cancer case management environment while involving all stakeholders to improve care treatment outcomes, ensure early diagnosis and increase patient's survival chances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u62a4\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u501f\u9274GitHub\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684bug\u4fee\u590d\u539f\u7406\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5404\u62a4\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u4e0d\u7545\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8bef\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGitHub\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684bug\u4fee\u590d\u539f\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Any-Logic\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684bug\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u5219\u548cGitHub\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u7ba1\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5404\u62a4\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u764c\u75c7\u62a4\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. (1) Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. (2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.\n  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.\n  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextCRBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1)\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b(2)\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff1b(3)\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1)\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u722c\u53d6\uff0c\u4ece\u9876\u7ea7\u4ed3\u5e93\u6536\u96c615.37\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\uff1b(2)\u5168\u9762\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u94fe\u63a5\u95ee\u9898-PR\u5bf9\u83b7\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u7c7b\u83b7\u53d6\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b(3)\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u8fc7\u65f6\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u523067,910\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6761\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516b\u4e2a\u9886\u5148LLM\uff08\u56db\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\uff09\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ecd\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u5ba1\u67e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0cContextCRBench\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u6f14\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534761.98%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextCRBench\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

While notebooks excel at iterative development and visualization, they often lack proper software engineering principles, making their transition to production environments challenging. This paper presents Codelevate, a novel multi-agent system that automatically transforms Jupyter notebooks into well-structured, maintainable Python code repositories. Our system employs three specialized agents - Architect, Developer, and Structure - working in concert through a shared dependency tree to ensure architectural coherence and code quality. Our experimental results validate Codelevate's capability to bridge the prototype-to-production gap through autonomous code transformation, yielding quantifiable improvements in code quality metrics while preserving computational semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Codelevate\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06Jupyter\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u578b\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "Jupyter\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u539f\u578b\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5e08\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Codelevate\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5f25\u5408\u539f\u578b\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "Codelevate\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Jupyter\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u5411\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
