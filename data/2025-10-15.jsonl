We formally ground this kind of reasoning and\nconnect it to standard formal approaches through language design and\nmeta-analysis, which leads to a functional style of compositional formal\nreasoning for a class of distributed systems, including cases involving\nByzantine faults. The core of our approach is twin languages: Sync and Async,\nwhich formalize the insight from distributed system theory that an asynchronous\nsystem can be reduced to a synchronous system for more straightforward\nreasoning under certain conditions. Sync describes a distributed system as a\nsingle, synchronous, data-parallel program. It restricts programs syntactically\nand has a functional denotational semantics suitable for Hoare-style formal\nreasoning. Async models a distributed system as a collection of interacting\nmonadic programs, one for each non-faulty node in the system. It has a standard\ntrace-based operational semantics, modeling asynchrony with interleaving. Sync\ncompiles to Async and can then be extracted to yield executable code. We prove\nthat any safety property proven for a Sync program in its denotational\nsemantics is preserved in the operational semantics of its compiled Async\nprograms.

Tiu has shown\nhow this restriction can be eased by utilizing a weaker notion referred to as\nground stratification. Tiu's results were limited to a version of the logic\nthat does not treat inductive definitions. We show here that they can be\nextended to cover such definitions. While our results are obtained by using\ntechniques that have been previously deployed in related ways in this context,\ntheir use is sensitive to the particular way in which we generalize the logic.\nIn particular, although ground stratification may be used with arbitrary\nfixed-point definitions, we show that weakening stratification to this form for\ninductive definitions leads to inconsistency. The particular generalization we\ndescribe accords well with the way logical relations are used in practice. Our\nresults are also a intermediate step to building a more flexible form for\ndefinitions into the full logic underlying Abella, which additionally includes\nco-induction, generic quantification, and a mechanism referred to as nominal\nabstraction for analyzing occurrences of objects in terms that are governed by\ngeneric quantifiers."}

Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten\nexperienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions:\ncreativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and\ncriticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting,\ncontrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted\ndevelopment. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring\nboundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel\nforms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges\nregarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity.

Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature\nReview (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and\nselecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges\nfall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system\norchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs.
