The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not\nprimarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification\nover a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted\nlanguage, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the\ntype of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references\nare added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode\nrecursion.

A relevant problem in CPS design is\nhow to efficiently and automatically check whether a set of STL requirements is\nlogically consistent. This problem reduces to solving the STL satisfiability\nproblem, which is decidable when we assume that our system operates in discrete\ntime steps dictated by an embedded system's clock.\n  This paper introduces a novel tree-shaped, one-pass tableau method for\nsatisfiability checking of discrete-time STL with bounded temporal operators.\nOriginally designed to prove the consistency of a given set of STL\nrequirements, this method has a wide range of applications beyond consistency\nchecking.

Poor-quality\nanswers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and\nthus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To\nimprove content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise\nanswers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have\nexamined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior\nresearch has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key\nquality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++\nvulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we\nanalyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to\ndetermine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)\ncode complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)\nreadability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.\nWhile 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them\nless relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working\ncode (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity\n(32.3%), making code harder to maintain.

It requires deep domain\nexpertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs\namong competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving\nrequirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited\ndesign alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across\nvarious SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively\nscarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain\nknowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed\nMAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a\nknowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD\norchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and\nEvaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce\narchitectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation\nreports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative\nexperiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show\nthat MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural\ncomponents and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation\nreports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements\nspecifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally\nexplored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,\nDeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance\nin producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection\nin MAS-driven architecture design.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u84dd\u56fe\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "MAAD\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u5e08\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e08\uff09\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u683c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "MAAD\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eMetaGPT\uff0c\u4e14\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002GPT-4o\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "MAAD\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86LLM\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To\nthis aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure\nneeded to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the\ncommunity's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as\nissues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing\ncontributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process\nfaces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.\nTo foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly\ndeploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and\ninclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the\nmain model to follow.

However, optimizations for\nfitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on\nhistorical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been\nexercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,\nand the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence\nindicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to\npredict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural\nnetworks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually\nimitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions\nthat have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a\nReinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition\nsequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine\nhistorical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path\ntransition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of\nfuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we\npropose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the\ncritical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target\nefficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepGo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b9a\u5411\u7070\u76d2\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u5411\u7070\u76d2\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08DGF\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u672a\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9884\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06DGF\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u79fb\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u96c6\u6210\u73af\u5883\uff08VEE\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ca\u5176\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLF\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u79fb\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec4\u6982\u5ff5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "DeepGo\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepGo\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u5411\u7070\u76d2\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However,\nit introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between\ndifferent PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection\ntools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language\nmodels (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language\ncode identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL\ncombinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction\ntypes. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their\nperformance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and\ncode comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before\nfine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after\nfine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,\nsmall fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs\nfine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,\ndemonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.\nAdditionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved\nperformance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model\nperformance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned\nCodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CodeLMs\uff09\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff08CLBs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177CLCFinder\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCLB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684CodeLMs\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dUniXcoder-base\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff08CLBs\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22CodeLMs\u5728CLB\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CLCFinder\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6d89\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u5408\u7684CLB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e8613\u4e2aCodeLMs\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540eCodeLMs\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cUniXcoder-base\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08F1=0.7407\uff09\u3002\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeLMs\u5728CLB\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9488\u5bf9CLB\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}
