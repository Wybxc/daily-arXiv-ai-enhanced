Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP.

Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit\ninstructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate\nhighly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such\nannotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without\nthem. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The\nfirst stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code\npreceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.\nSuch preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we\ndesign a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through\nstep-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is\ngenerated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement\nmechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for\nintent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate\nintentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred\nintent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the\nLLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To\nsupport this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with\nintermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings.

We develop CGOAnalyzer, a tool to efficiently\nidentify and quantify CGO-related features. Our findings reveal that: (1) 11.3%\nof analyzed Go projects utilize CGO, with usage concentrated in a subset of\nprojects; (2) CGO serves 4 primary purposes, including system-level\ninteractions and performance optimizations, with 15 distinct usage patterns\nobserved; (3) 19 types of CGO-related issues exist, including one critical\nissue involving unnecessary pointer checks that pose risks of runtime crashes\ndue to limitations in the current Go compilation toolchain; (4) a temporary\nsolution reduces unnecessary pointer checks, mitigating crash risks, and (5) we\nsubmitted a proposal to improve the Go toolchain for a permanent fix, which has\nbeen grouped within an accepted proposal for future resolution. Our findings\nprovide valuable insights for developers and the Go team, enhancing development\nefficiency and reliability while improving the robustness of the Go toolchain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Go\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2dCGO\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86Go\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u65b0\u5174\u7684FFI\u5de5\u5177CGO\uff0c\u800cCGO\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86920\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90Go\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CGOAnalyzer\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316CGO\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b011.3%\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528CGO\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8619\u79cdCGO\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548cGo\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e34\u65f6\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}
