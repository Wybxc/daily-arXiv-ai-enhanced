In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental\ncongruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the\ncategorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an\nAHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a\ncongruence.

Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,\nPjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical\nthinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,\nfaculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient\ninstitutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,\ndesigning or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This\nresearch explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources\nthat facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data\nfrom 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising\nclosed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,\nalong with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative\ndata were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses\nunderwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,\nits adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and\nmanaging the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of\ninstitutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty\nare more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer\ncollaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives.

Therefore, many\ntechniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers.

To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques\nunconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers\nthat waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and\ngenerating false positive bug reports.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing\ntechnique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs\nto understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination\nconstraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling\nframework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz\ndrivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing\ncampaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,\nmultiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while\nsimultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or\nsuspension.\n  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled.

While existing\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and\nbenchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and\nclosed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To\nmitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance\nof widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase\nof WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we\nextensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG\nand similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B\nparameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval\ntechniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.\nBased on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both\nRAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with\nsimilarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of\nsimilarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where\nBM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior\nperformance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval\ntechniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.\nFurthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of\nRAG methods in real-world development environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u4fe1\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26RAG\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf926\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff080.5B\u81f3671B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26RAG\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bcd\u6cd5\uff08BM25\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff08GTE-Qwen\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bcd\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RAG\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
