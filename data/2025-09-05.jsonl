Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],\noffers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global\ninvariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types\n[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack\npractical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.\n  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping\nresources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically\nscoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only\nchoice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical\nlifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the\nhigher-order parametric nature of the language.\n  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible\nsharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop\nreachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel\ntwo-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for\narbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes\nlexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability\nformalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of\nflow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity.

In addition\nto preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors,\nalgorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the\nparallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability\nanalysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine\ndynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction\nrefinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample\nin the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly\ncomputing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the\nabstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided\nby the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a\nsymbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm\nwith support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the\nalgorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of\nimproved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring\nthe abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is\nfollowed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis.\nOptimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability\nanalysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed.

Second, we utilize this\nalgorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual\ntracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student\nprogramming behavior that can now be done at scale.\n  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree\nnodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code\nstates.

Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are\ncharacteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in\nways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to\nconfirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution\nof static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We\nconducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the\ninteractions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between\ncode smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions\nbetween code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies\nand decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total\ndependencies.
