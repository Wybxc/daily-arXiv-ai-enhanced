PennyLane provides a Python framework that seamlessly bridges quantum circuits and classical machine learning, enabling researchers to build, optimize, and deploy variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces PennyLane as a versatile tool for quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry applications. We demonstrate use cases including quantum kernel methods, variational quantum eigensolvers, portfolio optimization, and integration with classical ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Through concrete Python examples with widely used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, we show how PennyLane facilitates efficient quantum circuit construction, automatic differentiation, and hybrid optimization workflows. By situating PennyLane within the broader context of quantum computing and machine learning, we highlight its role as a methodological building block for quantum-enhanced data science.

However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.\n  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.\n  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u70ed\u7ad9\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u70ed\u7ad9\u6545\u969c\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u6c34\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u5230\u516c\u5f00\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86EnergyFaultDetector\u5f00\u6e90Python\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528ARCANA\u8fdb\u884c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6b63\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.98\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6F\u5206\u6570\uff080.83\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u62a5\u544a\u95ee\u9898\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u523060%\u7684\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a3.9\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u70ed\u7ad9\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.\n  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.\n  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u5206\u6cd5\uff08AI\u76f4\u63a5\u6309\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7ed9\u5206\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u6cd5\uff08AI\u5148\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u518d\u6839\u636e\u4fee\u590d\u60c5\u51b5\u7ed9\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u6279\u6539\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdAI\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c10\u500d\u6269\u5c55\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u914d\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Since functions over discrete structures lack overt derivatives, differentiable programs do not differentiate through them and limit where they can be used. For example, when programming a neural network, conditionals and iteration cannot be used everywhere; they can break the derivatives necessary for gradient-based learning to work. This limits the class of differentiable algorithms we can directly express, imposing restraints on how we build neural networks and differentiable programs more generally. However, these restraints are not fundamental. Recent work shows conditionals can be first-class, by compiling them into differentiable form as linear neurons. Similarly, this work shows iteration can be first-class -- by compiling to linear recurrent neurons. We present a minimal typed, higher-order and linear programming language with iteration called $\\textsf{Cajal}\\scriptstyle(\\mathbb{\\multimap}, \\mathbb{2}, \\mathbb{N})$. We prove its programs compile correctly to recurrent neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation, we conduct two experiments where we link these recurrent neurons against a neural network solving an iterative image transformation task. This determines part of its function prior to learning. As a result, the network learns faster and with greater data-efficiency relative to a neural network programmed without first-class iteration. A key lesson is that recurrent neurons enable a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4e8c\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u53e5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCajal\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fed\u4ee3\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fed\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u7f16\u7a0b\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

They achieve this by storing metadata that enables quick pruning (or inclusion) of subtrees when predicates on that metadata can prove that none (or all) of the data in a subtree affect the query result. Existing systems implement this pruning logic manually for each query predicate and data structure. We generalize and mechanize this class of optimization. Our method derives conditions for when subtrees can be pruned (or included wholesale), expressed in terms of the metadata available at each node. We efficiently generate these conditions using symbolic interval analysis, extended with new rules to handle geometric predicates (e.g., intersection, containment). Additionally, our compiler fuses compound queries (e.g., reductions on filters) into a single tree traversal. These techniques enable the automatic derivation of generalized single-index and dual-index tree joins that support a wide class of join predicates beyond standard equality and range predicates. The generated traversals match the behavior of expert-written code that implements query-specific traversals, and can asymptotically outperform the linear scans and nested-loop joins that existing systems fall back to when hand-written cases do not apply.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u6811\u526a\u679d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u8c13\u8bcd\u548c\u590d\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u53cc\u7d22\u5f15\u6811\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u8c13\u8bcd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u624b\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u526a\u679d\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u6811\u526a\u679d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u590d\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u6811\u904d\u5386\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u5de5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u65f6\u80fd\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u5faa\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u8c13\u8bcd\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis.

Their performance depends critically on data layout choices that affect cache utilization, memory bandwidth, and vectorization -- increasingly dominant factors in modern computing. Yet, in most programming systems, these layout choices are hopelessly entangled with the traversal logic. This entanglement prevents developers from independently optimizing data layouts and algorithms across different contexts, perpetuating a false dichotomy between performance and portability. We introduce Scion, a domain-specific language and compiler for specifying the data layouts of bounding volume hierarchies independent of tree traversal algorithms.

Traditional RTL design in languages like SystemVerilog composes modules through wiring-style connections that provide weak guarantees for behavioral correctness. While high-level synthesis (HLS) and emerging abstractions attempt to address this, they either introduce unpredictable overhead or restrict design generality. Although transactional HDLs provide a promising foundation by lifting design abstraction to atomic and composable rules, they solely model intra-cycle behavior and do not reflect the native temporal design characteristics, hindering applicability and productivity for FPGA programming scenarios.\n  We propose temporal hardware transactions, a new abstraction that brings cycle-level timing awareness to designers at the transactional language level. Our approach models temporal relationships between rules and supports the description of rules whose actions span multiple clock cycles, providing intuitive abstraction to describe multi-cycle architectural behavior. We implement this in Cement2, a transactional HDL embedded in Rust, enabling programming hardware constructors to build both intra-cycle and temporal transactions. Cement2's synthesis framework lowers description abstraction through multiple analysis and optimization phases, generating efficient hardware. With Cement2's abstraction, we program a RISC-V soft-core processor, custom CPU instructions, linear algebra kernels, and systolic array accelerators, leveraging the high-level abstraction for boosted productivity.

Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices.\n  We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph.

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies.

To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks.

In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.\n  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny.

Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage.

While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them.

Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions.

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases.

To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them.

We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\\% and significantly improves code quality.
