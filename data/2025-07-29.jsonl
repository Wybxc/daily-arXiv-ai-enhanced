This system (named ADVENTURE) is\ndesigned to deliver personalized programming exercises that are tailored to\nindividual learners' skill levels. ADVENTURE utilizes an ontology, named\nCONTINUOUS, which encompasses common concepts across multiple programming\nlanguages. The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming\nconcepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and\nrecommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by\nthe Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically\nestimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An\nexperimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based\non six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental\ngroups. The results indicate significant differences in four of six analyzed\nfeatures between these two modes. Notably, the adaptive mode demonstrates a\nsignificant difference over the random mode in two features, the submission of\ncorrect answers and the number of pass concepts. Therefore, these results\nunderscore that this adaptive learning support system may support learners in\npracticing programming exercises."}

We\nintroduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three\nkey categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout.

While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts.

Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique.

They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs.

While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted\nLLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests\npassing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and\n98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects."}

As libraries evolve, they may break the\ntacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral\nbreaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client\napplications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression\ntests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited\nlibrary coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the\nlibrary's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\nto client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests\nin a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose\nrecording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of\nclient tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These\nsequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact\ncontract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library\nevolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in\nthe contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this\ntechnique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically\ninstruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them. Through a\npreliminary case study on several client--library pairs with artificially\nseeded BBCs, we show that Gilesi reliably detects BBCs missed by client test\nsuites."}

When generating whitebox tests, it is essential to consider the\ndatabase's state (i.e., the data contained in the database) to achieve higher\ncode coverage and uncover more hidden faults. This article presents novel\ntechniques to enhance search-based software test generation for RESTful APIs\ninteracting with NoSQL databases. Specifically, we target the popular MongoDB\ndatabase, by dynamically analyzing (via automated code instrumentation) the\nstate of the database during the test generation process. Additionally, to\nachieve better results, our novel approach allows inserting NoSQL data directly\nfrom test cases. This is particularly beneficial when generating the correct\nsequence of events to set the NoSQL database in an appropriate state is\nchallenging or time-consuming. This method is also advantageous for testing\nread-only microservices. Our novel techniques are implemented as an extension\nof EvoMaster, the only open-source tool for white-box fuzzing RESTful APIs.\nExperiments conducted on six RESTful APIs demonstrated significant improvements\nin code coverage, with increases of up to 18% compared to existing white-box\napproaches. To better highlight the improvements of our novel techniques,\ncomparisons are also carried out with four state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers."}

Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)\noutperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code\ngeneration and fault detection.\n  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- \"invisible hands\"\nsuch as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM\nreproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.\n  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by\ndeliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the\nprompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large\nlocalization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because\nany offset should divert the model from the original fix.\n  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans\nbenchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.\nA first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the\nresult with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually\naudit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the\nAgresti-Coull-Wilson method."}
