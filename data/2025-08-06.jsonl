The Qunity\nlanguage, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form\nof a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the\nresulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working\nimplementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very\ninefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably\nlarge circuits.\n  In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum\ncontrol flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a\nwider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer\ncompelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a\ncomplete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity\ncode into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization\ntechniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including\nboth low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the\nhigh-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits\nand gates used by the compiler."}

High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,\nautomates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However,\nit faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and\noptimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable\ncapabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due\nto the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in\nthis domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS\ncode generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement\nVerilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes\ninto corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement\na fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code\ngeneration guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a\nsemi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the\nfunctionality of the generated HLS code. Our experiments show that SAGE-HLS,\nfined-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model, achieves a near 100% success rate\nin code synthesizability and a 75% success rate in functional correctness."}

Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility.

Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation.

Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE\ndecreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting.\nMoreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators\nfavor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong\nevidence of the effectiveness of our method."}

We introduce ReFuzzer, a\nframework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting\nand correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or\narray out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local\nLLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving\nfuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of\ndiverse yet valid test programs.\n  We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box\nfuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs'\nvalidity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of\n2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing\nsignificantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR\ngeneration components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute\nimprovement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing,\nenhancing testing effectiveness."}

At the very least when providing sample\nsolutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part\nof the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements.\n  Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while\nbeing easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are\nintensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more\ngeneral behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions.\nManually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related\nartifacts gets complicated quickly.\n  We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for\nmultiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building\nblocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations\nfor various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting\nartifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks.\nThis abstract description then serves as the common source from which related\nartifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of\nartifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of\ncontexts."}

One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing\nmachines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an\nabstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less\nchallenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM\nprogramming language provides support for their definition and execution. This,\nhowever, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the\noperational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines\naccept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools\nhave been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates\nmachine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically\nrenders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The\nthird is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation\ngraphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and\nillustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape\nTuring machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these\ntools are well-received and found useful by students."}

Comprehension of\npushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is\nnecessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding\nthat two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with\ndifferent stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel\ndynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language\nfor the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines.\nThese tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by\na nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise\nmanner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by\nallowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents\nhold when a machine transitions into it."}
