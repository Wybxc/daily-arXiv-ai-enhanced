PhD thesis", "summary": "In the first part, we develop layered monoidal theories - a generalisation of monoidal theories combining descriptions of a system at several levels. Via their representation as string diagrams, monoidal theories provide a graphical syntax with a visually intuitive notions of information flow and composition. Layered monoidal theories allow mixing several monoidal theories (together with translations between them) within the same string diagram, while retaining mathematical precision and semantic interpretability. We define three flavours of layered monoidal theories, provide a recursively generated syntax for each, and construct a free-forgetful adjunction with respect to three closely related semantics: opfibrations, fibrations and deflations. We motivate the general theory by providing several examples from existing literature.\n  In the second part, we develop a formal approach to retrosynthesis - the process of backwards reaction search in synthetic chemistry. Chemical processes are treated at three levels of abstraction: (1) (formal) reactions encode all chemically feasible combinatorial rearrangements of molecules, (2) reaction schemes encode transformations applicable to 'patches' of molecules (including the functional groups), and (3) disconnection rules encode local chemical rewrite rules applicable to a single bond or atom at a time. We show that the three levels are tightly linked: the reactions are generated by the reaction schemes, while there is a functorial translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions. Moreover, the translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions is shown to be sound, complete and universal - allowing one to treat the disconnection rules as a formal syntax with the semantics provided by the reactions. We tie together the two parts by providing a formalisation of retrosynthesis within a certain layered monoidal theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u6574\u5408\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u5f26\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9006\u5408\u6210\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "method": "1. \u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u9012\u5f52\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0eopfibration\u3001fibration\u548cdeflation\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u81ea\u7531-\u9057\u5fd8\u4f34\u968f\u51fd\u5b50\n2. \u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u9006\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u65ad\u952e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\u5173\u7cfb\n3. \u5c06\u9006\u5408\u6210\u5206\u6790\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5c42\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d", "result": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7406\u8bba\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5f26\u56fe\u8868\u793a\n2. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u9006\u5408\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff1a\u53cd\u5e94\u7531\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65ad\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u53cd\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u51fd\u5b50\u7ffb\u8bd1\n3. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65ad\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u4f7f\u65ad\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u6210\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u5e7a\u534a\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u591a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5316\u5b66\u9006\u5408\u6210\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u76f4\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881"}}

In the spatial setting, recoverability and durability (now known as persistency) are measured in units of distance. Like its temporal counterpart, spatial resiliency is of fundamental importance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and yet, to date, there is no widely agreed-upon formal treatment of spatial resiliency. We present a formal framework for reasoning about spatial resiliency in CPS. Our framework is based on the spatial fragment of STREL, which we refer to as SREL. In this framework, spatial resiliency is given a syntactic characterization in the form of a Spatial Resiliency Specification (SpaRS). An atomic predicate of SpaRS is called an S-atom. Given an arbitrary SREL formula $\\varphi$, distance bounds $d_1, d_2$, the S-atom of $\\varphi$, $S_{d_1, d_2} (\\varphi)$, is the SREL formula $\\neg\\varphi R_{[0,d_1]} (\\varphi R_{[d_2, +\\infty)}\\varphi)$, specifying that recovery from a violation of $\\varphi$ occurs within distance $d_1$ (recoverability), and subsequently that $\\varphi$ be maintained along a route for a distance greater than $d_2$ (persistency). S-atoms can be combined using spatial STREL operators, allowing one to express composite resiliency specifications. We define a quantitative semantics for SpaRS in the form of a Spatial Resilience Value (SpaRV) function $\u03c3$ and prove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. SREL's Boolean semantics. The $\u03c3$-value for $S_{d_1,d_2}(\\varphi)$ is a set of non-dominated (rec, per) pairs, quantifying recoverability and persistency, given that some routes may offer better recoverability while others better persistency. In addition, we design algorithms to evaluate SpaRV for SpaRS formulas. Finally, two case studies demonstrate the practical utility of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSREL\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u89c4\u8303(SpaRS)\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u503c(SpaRV)\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSTREL\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5SREL\u6784\u5efa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u89c4\u8303(SpaRS)\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcdS-atom\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u503c(SpaRV)\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30SpaRV\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SpaRV\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eSREL\u5e03\u5c14\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f39\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a formal framework for quantifying trust in third-party software dependencies that is both formally checkable - formalized in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) - while at the same time incorporating human factors, like the number of downloads, authors, and other metadata that are commonly used to identify trustworthy software in practice. We use data from both software analysis tools and metadata to build a first-order relational model of software dependencies; to obtain an overall \"trust cost\" combining these factors, we propose a formalization based on the minimum trust problem which asks for the minimum cost of a set of assumptions which can be used to prove that the code is safe. We implement these ideas in Cargo Sherlock, targeted for Rust libraries (crates), incorporating a list of candidate assumptions motivated by quantifiable trust metrics identified in prior work.

We introduce a novel framework, argumentative agentic models for case-based reasoning (AAM-CBR), which extends abstract argumentation for case-based reasoning (AA-CBR). Unlike traditional approaches that require factorization of previous cases, AAM-CBR leverages language models to determine case coverage and extract factors based on new cases. This enables factor-based reasoning without exposing or preprocessing previous cases, thus improving both flexibility and privacy. We also present initial experiments to assess AAM-CBR performance by comparing the proposed framework with a baseline that uses a single-prompt approach to incorporate both new and previous cases. The experiments are conducted based on a synthetic credit card application dataset. The result shows that AAM-CBR surpasses the baseline only when the new case contains a richer set of factors. The finding indicates that language models can handle case-based reasoning with a limited number of factors, but face challenges as the number of factors increase. Consequently, integrating symbolic reasoning with language models, as implemented in AAM-CBR, is crucial for effectively handling cases involving many factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAAM-CBR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u6848\u4f8b\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u975e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAAM-CBR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u8d23\u786e\u5b9a\u6848\u4f8b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u6848\u4f8b\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u66b4\u9732\u6216\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u7533\u8bf7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAAM-CBR\u4ec5\u5728\u5f53\u65b0\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u56e0\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff08\u5982AAM-CBR\u6240\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6848\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0", "motivation": "\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u6982\u7387\u548c\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u7279\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08\u6709\u9650\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff09\u5bf9\u53d7\u9650\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u9020", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5206\u5e03", "conclusion": "\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u9020\u5bf9\u5e94\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898"}}

Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement.

Despite their popularity, major security concerns arise during container development and deployment. Software Engineering (SE) research literature reveals a lack of reviewed, aggregated, and organized knowledge of risks, vulnerabilities, security practices, and tools in container-based systems development and deployment. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on 129 selected primary studies to explore and organize existing knowledge on security issues in software container systems. Data from the primary studies enabled us to identify critical risks and vulnerabilities across the container life-cycle and categorize them using a novel taxonomy. Additionally, the findings highlight the causes and implications and provide a list of mitigation techniques to overcome these risks and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we provide an aggregation of security practices and tools that can help support and improve the overall security of container systems. This study offers critical insights into the current landscape of security issues within software container systems. Our analysis highlights the need for future SE research to focus on security enhancement practices that strengthen container systems and develop effective mitigation strategies to comprehensively address existing risks and vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb9\u5668\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u800c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\u6027\u3001\u805a\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e129\u7bc7\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u4e00\u624b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5bb9\u5668\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5bb9\u5668\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u589e\u5f3a\u5bb9\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

Model selection is often performed in an ad hoc manner, relying on fragmented metadata and individual expertise, which can undermine reproducibility, transparency, and overall research software quality.\n  This work proposes a structured and evidence-driven approach to support AI model selection that aligns with both technical and contextual requirements. We conceptualize AI model selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and introduce an evidence-based decision-support framework that integrates automated data collection pipelines, a structured knowledge graph, and MCDM principles. Following the Design Science Research methodology, the proposed framework (ModelSelect) is empirically validated through 50 real-world case studies and comparative experiments against leading generative AI systems.\n  The evaluation results show that ModelSelect produces reliable, interpretable, and reproducible recommendations that closely align with expert reasoning. Across the case studies, the framework achieved high coverage and strong rationale alignment in both model and library recommendation tasks, performing comparably to generative AI assistants while offering superior traceability and consistency.\n  By framing AI model selection as an MCDM problem, this work establishes a rigorous foundation for transparent and reproducible decision support in research software engineering.

We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u572830\u4e2aPython\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b092%\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u96f6\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f15\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BM25\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u3001BGE\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u548cNeo4j\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2aPython\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684180\u4e2a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u523092%\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u96f6\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad814-18\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u572862%\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u5f15\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\u3002\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f15\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f15\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works.", "AI": {"tldr": "SWE-Playground\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u5934\u751f\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56GitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSWE-Playground\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u5934\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4ece\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e93\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSWE-Playground\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5177\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE-Playground\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR >= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores.

Krasnovsky"], "title": "Evaluating Asynchronous Semantics in Trace-Discovered Resilience Models: A Case Study on the OpenTelemetry Demo", "comment": null, "summary": "While distributed tracing and chaos engineering are becoming standard for microservices, resilience models remain largely manual and bespoke. We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u97e7\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceOpenTelemetry\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u670d\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u7aef\u70b9\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u97e7\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u4e14\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u539f\u59cbOpenTelemetry\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u670d\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u7aef\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u6b65\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406Kafka\u8fb9\u7f18\uff08\u975e\u963b\u585e\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u4f30\u8ba1\u7aef\u70b9\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7GitHub Actions\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u6df7\u6c8c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9000\u5316\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f02\u6b65\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9Kafka\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff08\u7ea610^-5\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8be5\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6HTTP\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd9\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u97e7\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration.

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

However, the approach raises measurable trade-offs: reducing false positives in verification tasks while simultaneously increasing false negatives in detection tasks, requiring careful decision on the required level of agreement among the LLMs (threshold) for increased performance across different security contexts.\n  Artifact: https://github.com/Erroristotle/DVDR_LLM", "AI": {"tldr": "DVDR-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u534710-12%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u591a\u6587\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u590d\u6742\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDVDR-LLM\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9608\u503c\u6765\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "DVDR-LLM\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad810-12%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5bf9\u591a\u6587\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u534718%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534711.8%\u3002\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6f0f\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u6f0f\u62a5\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, this growth is accompanied by increased attention from malicious actors, resulting in a significant rise in security threats to the Android ecosystem. Among these threats, the adoption of Anti-Runtime Analysis (ARA) techniques by malicious applications poses a serious challenge, as it hinders security professionals from effectively analyzing malicious behaviors using dynamic analysis tools. ARA technologies are designed to prevent the dynamic examination of applications, thus complicating efforts to ensure platform security. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study that assesses the ability of widely-used Android dynamic analysis tools to bypass various ARA techniques.

A 5-split cross-validation approach was used to train and evaluate the CNN model, which takes tokenized source code as input.\n  The findings indicated that Sherlock successfully detected multiple vulnerabilities at the function level, and its performance was particularly strong for CWE-199, CWE-120, and CWE-Other, with an overall high accuracy rate and significant true positive and true negative values.

Understanding the current state of practice of software engineering higher education can empower educators to critically assess their courses, fine-tune them by benchmarking against observed practices, and ultimately enhance their curricula. In this study, we aim to provide an encompassing analysis of higher education on software engineering by considering the higher educational offering of an entire European country, namely the Netherlands. We leverage a crowd-sourced analysis process by considering 10 Dutch universities and 207 university courses. The courses are analysed via knowledge areas adopted from the SWEBOK. The mapping process is refined via homogenisation and internal consistency improvement phases, and is followed by a data analysis phase. Given its fundamental nature, Construction and Programming is the most covered knowledge area at Bachelor level. Other knowledge areas are equally covered at Bachelor and Master level (e.g., software engineering models), while more advanced ones are almost exclusively covered at Master level. We identify three clusters of tightly coupled knowledge areas: (i) requirements, architecture, and design, (ii) testing, verification, and security, and (iii) process-oriented and DevOps topics. Dutch universities generally cover all knowledge areas uniformly, with minor deviations reflecting institutional research strengths.

[Aims] Our goal is to introduce and evaluate seven attributes identified in the SE literature as relevant for formulating research problems (practical problem, context, implications/impacts, practitioners, evidence, objective, and research questions) in terms of their perceived importance and completeness, and learn how they can be applied. [Method] We conducted a workshop with 42 senior SE researchers during the ISERN 2024 meeting. The seven attributes were presented using a Problem Vision board filled with a research example. Participants discussed attributes in groups, shared written feedback, and individually completed a survey assessing their importance, completeness, and suggestions for improvement. [Results] The findings confirm the importance of the seven attributes in the formulation of industry-oriented research problems. Qualitative feedback illustrated how they can be applied in practice and revealed suggestions to refine them, such as incorporating financial criteria (e.g., ROI) into implications/impacts and addressing feasibility and constraints under evidence. [Conclusion] The results reaffirm the importance of the seven attributes in supporting a reflective and context-aware problem formulation. Adapting their use to specific research contexts can help to improve the alignment between academic research and industry needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u826f\u597d\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728ISERN 2024\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e42\u4f4d\u8d44\u6df1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\"\u95ee\u9898\u613f\u666f\u677f\"\u5c55\u793a\u4e03\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5206\u7ec4\u8ba8\u8bba\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e66\u9762\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u5b8c\u6210\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u5236\u5b9a\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u5f71\u54cd/\u540e\u679c\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u8d22\u52a1\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5982ROI\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u7533\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u60c5\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

The descriptive evaluation of the scenario suggests that AI agent support can enrich collaborative discussions and enhance critical reflection on the value, feasibility, and applicability of the research problem.

Thus, they may form a gateway to wider and more economic use of formal methods in industrial embedded software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "THADs\uff08\u65f6\u5e8fHAL-API\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4e00\u7c7b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6ce8\u89e3\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u89c4\u8303\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\uff09\u548c\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6ce8\u89e3\u6765\u6307\u5b9aTHADs\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "THADs\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u5de5\u4f5c\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "THADs\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5165\u53e3\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5730\u5e26\u3002"}}

The diversity of blockchain patterns and lack of standardized frameworks linking business goals to technical design decisions make pattern selection a complex task for system architects. To address this challenge, we propose Blockchain--Technology-Aware Enterprise Modeling (BC-TEAEM), a decision support framework that combines ontologies of blockchain patterns and domain-independent soft goals with a multi-criteria decision-making approach. The framework focuses on the interplay between a domain expert and a technical expert to ensure alignment and traceability. By iteratively capturing and refining preferences, BC-TEAEM supports systematic selection of blockchain patterns.

We address this gap by introducing code-aligned use case benchmarks, constructed through manual validation of both user-goal and subfunction use cases across nine real-world software projects. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems. The models also exhibit high omission rates and struggle to maintain consistent abstraction when aggregating subfunctions into user-goal use cases, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LLM-based use case reverse engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e5d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7528\u6237\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u540d\u79f0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\u3002", "result": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9879\u76ee\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9057\u6f0f\u7387\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u805a\u5408\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u7528\u4f8b\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u62bd\u8c61\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.", "AI": {"tldr": "PSALM\u5c06\u6bd4\u4f8b\u62bd\u6837\u7b56\u7565(PSS)\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8715\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u8715\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u62bd\u6837\u7b56\u7565(PSS)\u6709\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPSALM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u4f8b\u62bd\u6837\u7b56\u7565(PSS)\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660ePSALM\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5212\u5206\u4e0b\u90fd\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u88ab\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c184\u4e2a\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\uff0cPSALM\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565(\u5982ART\u548cMT-ART)\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PSALM\u4e3a\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u575a\u5b9e\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u8715\u53d8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors.

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance.

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "DARS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u5546\u5361\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u884c\u4e1a\u8bbf\u8c08\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u9700\u6c42\u5e26\u6765\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\uff08DARS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u5546\u5361\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u539f\u5b50\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u611f\u77e5\u6848\u4f8b\u548c18\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDARS\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DARS\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u5fc5\u987b\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u4eca\u667a\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

The Data-Light SE Challenge", "comment": null, "summary": "Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested?\n  The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization).\n  Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.\n  For the purposes of open science, our scripts and data are online at https://github.com/KKGanguly/NEO .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aSE\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u768490%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\"\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u800c\u975e\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "1) \u5bf9\u6570\u5341\u4e2aSE\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f6f\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u591a\u6837\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u3001\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff1b4) \u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b5) \u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f7b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8fd190%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eSMAC\u3001TPE\u3001DEHB\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb8\u591aSE\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6570\u636e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6311\u6218\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
