An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design Principle Violations", "comment": "Accepted to ASE2025", "summary": "Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,\nsuch as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong\nunderstanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis."}

Our framework delivers a comprehensive,\ncontainerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential\nassessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail\nexecution against the modified code.

A common approach is\nan iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are\nproduced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs\nto address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules\n- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in\nthe source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a\npipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process\ndescriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in\nLADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment\nchecks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX\nto study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of\nLLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of\nalgorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.\n  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with\nexpert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This\nenables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on\ntwo datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural\nvalidity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)\nalgorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks\nfail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness\nby 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks\nwith LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4\nMini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of\nup to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer\nthan five LLM calls on average."}
