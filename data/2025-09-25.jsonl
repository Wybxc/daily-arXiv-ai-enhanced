This embedding is used as part of a testing framework for a compilers\ncourse to derive interpreters for all the intermediate languages. The embedding\nimplements features including safe, functional abstractions as well as unsafe\nassembly features, and the interactions between the two at various intermediate\nstages.\n  This paper aims to demonstrate language-oriented techniques and abstractions\nfor implementing (1) a large family of languages and (2) interoperability\nbetween low- and high-level languages. The primary strength of this approach is\nthe high degree of code reuse and interoperability compared to implementing\neach interpreter separately. The design emphasizes modularity and\ncompositionality of an open set of language features by local macro expansion\ninto a single host language, rather than implementing a language pre-defined by\na closed set of features. This enables reuse from both the host language\n(Racket) and between intermediate languages, and enables interoperability\nbetween high- and low-level features, simplifying development of the\nintermediate language semantics. It also facilitates extending or redefining\nindividual language features in intermediate languages, and exposing multiple\ninterfaces to the embedded languages."}

Unfortunately, existing\nmodels of compilation using multi-language semantics define two variants of\neach compiler pass: a syntactic translation on open terms to model compilation,\nand a run-time translation of closed terms at multi-language boundaries to\nmodel interoperability.\n  In this talk, I discuss work-in-progress approach to uniformly model a\ncompiler entirely as a reduction system on open term in a multi-language\nsemantics, rather than as a syntactic translation. This simultaneously defines\nthe compiler and the interoperability semantics, reducing duplication. It also\nprovides interesting semantic insights. Normalization of the cross-language\nredexes performs ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. Evaluation in the\nmulti-language models just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Confluence of\nmulti-language reduction implies compiler correctness, and part of the secure\ncompilation proof (full abstraction), enabling focus on the difficult part of\nthe proof.

Both problems become apparent\nin _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and\noutputs are the responses of these parties.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines\ninput generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O\ngrammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics\nof protocols, including messages, states, and interactions.
