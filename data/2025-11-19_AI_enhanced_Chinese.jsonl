While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlakyGuard\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fe\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u627e\u5230\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u51cf\u7f13\u53d1\u5e03\u5468\u671f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982FlakyDoctor\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u592a\u5c11\u6216\u592a\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fe\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u627e\u5230\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fc7\u591a\u6216\u8fc7\u5c11\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlakyGuard\u4fee\u590d\u4e8647.6%\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d51.8%\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u88ab\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u9ad8\u51fa22%\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FlakyGuard\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fe\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a100%\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u7528\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4e24\u8f6e\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u98ce\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u4e24\u8f6e\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210Python\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u4fee\u8ba2\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u4efb\u52a1\u56fa\u5b9a\uff08N=160\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u793a\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\uff1b\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u5c06\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u4e865\u4e2a\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NASA\u7684FRET\u5de5\u5177\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u9700\u6c42\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8d21\u732e\u4e865\u4e2a\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

It is critical to understanding and mitigating operational issues caused by power supply noise (PSN) early in the design process: fluctuations in network traffic in modern NoC designs cause dramatic variations in power delivery across the network, leading to unreliability and errors in data transfers. Further complicating these challenges, NoC designs vary widely in size, usage, and implementation. This case study paper presents a principled, systematic, and modular NoC modeling approach using the Modest language that closely reflects the standard hierarchical design approach in digital systems. Using the Modest Toolset, functional and quantitative correctness was established for several NoC models, all of which were instantiated from a generic modular router model. Specifically, this work verifies the functional correctness of a generic router, inter-router communication, and the entire NoC.

While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional \"independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging\" to \"AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization.\" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u63a2\u8ba8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u6218\u7565\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236AI\u8d21\u732e\u7ea630%\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u3002", "motivation": "ChatGPT\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u82f1\u56fd\u4e00\u6240\u9ad8\u6821\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u7684\u6218\u7565\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\"AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u601d-\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f16\u7a0b-\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\"\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u5b66\u751f\u9650\u5236ChatGPT\u8d21\u732e\u7ea630%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a0\u6df1\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u62d2\u7edd\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e0eAI\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations.

While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \\textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoCoBench-Agent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86LoCoBench\u76848000\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5982LoCoBench\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u8f6e\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LoCoBench\u76848000\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b8\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u6587\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\uff09\uff0c\u572810K\u52301M\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u542b9\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6548\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cLoCoBench-Agent\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Scene Graphs (SGs) allow for an explicit structured representation of objects present in a traffic scene and their spatial relationships to each other. In this paper, we build upon the SG construct and propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) formalism to formalize spatial properties of ADFs. We show using real-world examples how spatial properties can be formalized using ASGs. Finally, we present a framework that uses ASGs to perform Runtime Monitoring of ADFs.

In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the  Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Safe-ROS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u7b49\u4e25\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8d23\u5e38\u89c4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4eea\u8868\u529f\u80fd(SIFs)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0SIF\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ddd\u79bb\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fc7\u8fd1\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "result": "\u5728AgileX Scout Mini\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6838\u73af\u5883\u5de1\u68c0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Safe-ROS\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LogPurge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u514d\u8d39\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6574\u5408\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u9664\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5269\u4f59\u6c61\u67d3\u533a\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6709\u6548\u51c0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u79fb\u9664\u4e8698.74%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8682.39%\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65e5\u5fd7\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF-1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8635.7%\u548c84.11%\uff0c\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86149.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "LogPurge\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u51c0\u5316\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management.

We obtain MaxSAT variants of proof systems such as SPR, PR, SR, and others, previously defined for SAT.\n  All our rules are polynomially checkable, unlike [Ihalainen et$.$al'22]. Moreover, they are simpler and weaker than [Berg et$.$al'23], and possibly amenable to lower bounds.\n  This work also complements the approach of [Bonacina et$.$al'24]. Their proof systems use different rule sets for soft and hard clauses, while here we propose a system using only hard clauses and blocking variables. This is easier to integrate with current solvers and proof checkers.\n  We discuss the strength of the systems introduced, we show some limitations of them, and we give a short cost-SR proof that any assignment for the weak pigeonhole principle $PHP^{m}_{n}$ falsifies at least $m-n$ clauses.\n  We conclude by discussing the integration of our rules with the MaxSAT resolution proof system, which is a commonly studied proof system for MaxSAT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MaxSAT\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u5f31\u4f46\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0eMaxSAT\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "SAT\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6982\u5ff5\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728MaxSAT\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06SAT\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982SPR\u3001PR\u3001SR\u7b49\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230MaxSAT\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MaxSAT\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u5b50\u53e5\u548c\u963b\u585e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u90fd\u662f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u9e3d\u5de2\u539f\u7406$PHP^{m}_{n}$\u7684\u7b80\u77edcost-SR\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u8d4b\u503c\u90fd\u4f1a\u8fdd\u53cd\u81f3\u5c11$m-n$\u4e2a\u5b50\u53e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MaxSAT\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0eMaxSAT\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "KTester\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u9879\u76ee\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u6b63\u786e\u53c8\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u9879\u76ee\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7528\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\uff1b3) \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u8003\u8651\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cKTester\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6267\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u63d0\u9ad85.69%\uff0c\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88.83%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u786e\u8ba4KTester\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "KTester\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002"}}

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation. We highlight directions for future research such as longitudinal and task diverse replications with larger samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u8d28\u5219\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u53d7\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5bf980\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0840\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c40\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Baddeley\u8bed\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08IPIP NEO 50\uff09\u548c9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff086\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u5173\uff0c3\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\uff1b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6700\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4e0e\u4e24\u8005\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u8d28\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5171\u540c\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u800c\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

This paper presents FHIRconnect, a novel domain-specific language and open-source transformation engine that enables standardized, bidirectional data exchange between openEHR and FHIR. Our approach addresses critical interoperability gaps through a triple-layered architecture that achieves 65% mapping reuse across projects by leveraging international archetype-based foundations while supporting local customizations. Using this framework, FHIRconnect successfully mapped 24 international archetypes to 15 FHIR profiles across seven clinical domains. Key contributions include the first comprehensive DSL for openEHR-FHIR transformation with a formal specification, an open-source execution engine (openFHIR), and an accessible mapping library covering high-impact clinical archetypes.

A Theory on Motivations and Challenges in Software Engineering from Education to Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Motivations and challenges jointly shape how individuals enter, persist, and evolve within software engineering (SE), yet their interplay remains underexplored across the transition from education to professional practice. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and employed the Gioia Methodology, an adapted grounded theory methodology from organizational behavior, to inductively derive taxonomies of motivations and challenges, and build the Exposure-Pursuit-Evaluation (EPE) Process Model. Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field.
