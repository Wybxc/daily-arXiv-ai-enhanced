To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this\nintuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency\nof mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and\nestablish their correctness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6539\u670d\u52a1\u529f\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u539f\u5b50\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

For instance, a\nchange that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.\nEstablishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate\nchanges effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature\ndeployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our\nstudy revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over\nthe past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often\nspend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a\nmedian of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify\ndependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML\nmodels. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,\nwhile the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes.

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo.

Mainstream benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning\nbenchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity\nscenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,\nlimiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present\nSTEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex\nmulti-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench\nfeatures tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,\nchained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and\ndata flow modeling. It defines \"computation steps\" as the minimal execution\nunit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning\ntasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution\nbeyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including\n14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly\ndiscriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent\naccuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on\nprevious benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained\nreasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,\nsymbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation\nand quality assurance.
