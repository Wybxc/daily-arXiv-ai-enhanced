In this paper we introduce\nfirst-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD\nwith little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three\nloosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code\ntransformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward\nlifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order\narray language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable\naspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for\nhigher-order code.\n  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a\ncarefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and\n'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)\nhigher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially\npresented with a first-order program.

They collaboratively perform\nvarious tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses\non integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world\nstakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an\nartifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger\nthe next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new\nrequirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to\nsupport human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align\nwith the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and\nresults show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects.

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises\nseveral new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code\nprovenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly\nconcerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its\ncompliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the\nother hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to\nmanual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.\nAlthough some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods\nfor detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness\nwhen facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective\nsolution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may\nundergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of\nCodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against\ninput perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation\nmodule, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which\nsystematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial\nsamples.
