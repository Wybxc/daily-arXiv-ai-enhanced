GPS\ncan find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs\nthat trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that\nrenders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,\ninput-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense\nthat it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we\nintroduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve\nrefutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance.

Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer\ninference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for\nergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes\nprogram behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably\ndivergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics\nwith inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without\nintroducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,\nuntyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based\nimperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference\nrules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is\nequivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions.

While this\ntechnique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains\nlargely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of\nKD in code understanding tasks.

Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,\nled to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a\nworkshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.\nNew ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a\nre-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations\nfor TD prioritization."}

To cope with these incidents, it is important to\ntimely detect their occurrences, localize the sources of the problems, and\nimplement the appropriate countermeasures. This paper reports our experience\nwith a state-of-the-art failure prediction method, PREVENT, and its extension\nwith a troubleshooting module, REACT, applied to naval systems developed by\nFincantieri. Our results show how to integrate anomaly detection with\ntroubleshooting procedures. We conclude by discussing a lesson learned, which\nmay help deploy and extend these analyses to other industrial products."}

The\nsummaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible\npaths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS\ncan find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs\nthat trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that\nrenders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,\ninput-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense\nthat it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we\nintroduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve\nrefutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked\nGPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software\nVerification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that\nour implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers\n(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in\nterms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time."}
