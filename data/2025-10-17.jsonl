In particular,\ninteraction trees have emerged as a popular denotational semantics. Interaction\ntrees achieve compositionality by providing a reusable library of effects.\nHowever, their notion of effects does not support higher-order effects, i.e.,\neffects that take or return monadic computations. Such effects are essential to\nmodel complex semantic features like parallel composition and call/cc.\n  We introduce Higher-Order Interaction Trees (HITrees), the first variant of\ninteraction trees to support higher-order effects in a non-guarded type theory.\nHITrees accomplish this through two key techniques: first, by designing the\nnotion of effects such that the fixpoints of effects with higher-order input\ncan be expressed as inductive types inside the type theory; and second, using\ndefunctionalization to encode higher-order outputs into a first-order\nrepresentation. We implement HITrees in the Lean proof assistant, accompanied\nby a comprehensive library of effects including concurrency, recursion, and\ncall/cc. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of HITrees, as state\ntransition systems and as monadic programs. To demonstrate the expressiveness\nof HITrees, we apply them to define the semantics of a language with parallel\ncomposition and call/cc."}

Second,\nit derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the\ncontrol flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads\nto the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by\nsolving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the\ncorrectness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and\nmitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate\na large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that\nPathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex\nprogram structures such as loops and recursion."}

The study instrument, co-designed by\nmembers of the ENACTEST project consortium, was developed collaboratively and\nrefined through multiple iterations to ensure comprehensive coverage of\nindustry needs and educational gaps.

Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or\nsupervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a\n``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover\nnovel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we\nintroduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial\nreinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code\ngenerator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy.\nThis dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging\ncurrent policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to\nlearn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling\nof static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical\nutility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N\ninference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation\nmodels. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the\nreliability of LLM-generated code."}

One critical but underexplored\napplication is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms\nvulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest\npromising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web\nvulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web\nvulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software\nengineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including\ntechnical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors,\non 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three\ntop-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation\non our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types\nand 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve\nreasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently\nfail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component\nenvironments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers\ncreate a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual\nvulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with\nperformance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.\nOur findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent\ncapabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,\nemphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous\nproblem-solving capabilities."}

Such attacks are very rare but may\nhave a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated\ntools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of\nboth the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an\nunsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying\ncohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion\n(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is\nintroduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707\nfunctions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection\nreduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive\nnames compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of\nreal supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme\ntest-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC\ncan effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100\nof 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that\nautomated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based\ncohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving\nsource code integrity."}

A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in\naddition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has\nseen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on\nstatic and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom\nhas been that this is the primary challenge.\n  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations\ncan often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to\nrecompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and\nmultifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.\n  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning\nalmost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA\nmigration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and\ndemonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these\ntasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research\nchallenges that warrant further attention."}
