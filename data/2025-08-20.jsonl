Efficient data engineering is\ncritical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern\ndata lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer\nfeatures such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time\ningestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support\ncomplex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet,\nIceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with\nfields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The\nevaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query\nperformance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key\nfindings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance,\nIceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native\nworkloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental\nprocessing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel,\nand update semantics. The study offers insights for selecting or combining\nformats to support fleet management, predictive maintenance, and route\noptimization. Using structured datasets and realistic queries, the results\nprovide practical guidance for scaling data pipelines and integrating machine\nlearning models in automotive applications."}

However, these visual aids do not\nseem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since\nthe code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these\nadditional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response\ntimes for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can\nreduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played\nby formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate\nthe impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through\nlarge-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four\nprogramming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\\#) and ten LLMs-including both\ncommercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and\nperformance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that\nLLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,\nachieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\\% with negligible output\ntoken reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization\nstrategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both\nprompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to\n36.1\\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate\npractical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for\nformat processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM\ninference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency."}
