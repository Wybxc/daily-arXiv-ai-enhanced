However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory\nPrediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,\ntrajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs\n(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary\ndifficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future\ntrajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This\nresearch presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic\nmethodology for testing multimodal HTP systems.

Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both\nhistorical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an\nenvironmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric\ntransformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and\nmap inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)\nMap-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing\nobstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions.

The\nsystem integrates operating system level system tracking to prompt engagement\nand its chatbot leverages ADHD-specific resources to offer relevant responses.\nPreliminary validation through self-use revealed improved contextual accuracy\nfollowing iterative prompt refinements and RAG enhancements. Tether\ndifferentiates itself from generic tools by being adaptable and aligned with\nsoftware-specific workflows and ADHD-related challenges. While not yet\nevaluated by target users, this work lays the foundation for future\nneurodiversity-aware tools in SE and highlights the potential of LLMs as\npersonalized support systems for underrepresented cognitive needs."}

We present a framework that integrates\nspectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and\nChain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike\nprior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis\nwith LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing\ntests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new\ncandidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the\nresults, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent\nmodifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain\nunresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where\nour approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute\nimprovement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT.\nThis outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical\nprogram analysis with generative AI in automated debugging."}

This means testing the expected\noutcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike\ndeterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test\ninput. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a\nprobabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel\nblack-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of\nprobabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a\nwell-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this\nmethod, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the\nnumber of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical\nguarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a\nwell-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in,\ndevelopers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the\nnecessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on\ncase studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized\ndata structure."}

We devise a set of properties for Java classes\nthat are proven to ensure thread-safety. We encode these properties in the\nstatic analysis tool CodeQL to automatically analyze Java source code. We\nperform an evaluation on the top 1000 GitHub repositories. The evaluation\ncomprises 3632865 Java classes; with 1992 classes annotated as @ThreadSafe from\n71 repositories. These repositories include highly popular software such as\nApache Flink (24.6k stars), Facebook Fresco (17.1k stars), PrestoDB (16.2k\nstarts), and gRPC (11.6k starts). Our queries detected thousands of\nthread-safety errors. The running time of our queries is below 2 minutes for\nrepositories up to 200k lines of code, 20k methods, 6000 fields, and 1200\nclasses. We have submitted a selection of detected concurrency errors as PRs,\nand developers positively reacted to these PRs.

While recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have led to mature\nsolutions for solving these complex problems, SDMs remain vulnerable to\nlearning unsafe behaviors, posing significant risks in safety-critical\napplications. However, developing a testing framework for SDMs that can\nidentify a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios remains an open challenge.\nTo address this, we propose CureFuzz, a novel curiosity-driven black-box fuzz\ntesting approach for SDMs. CureFuzz proposes a curiosity mechanism that allows\na fuzzer to effectively explore novel and diverse scenarios, leading to\nimproved detection of crashtriggering scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a\nmulti-objective seed selection technique to balance the exploration of novel\nscenarios and the generation of crash-triggering scenarios, thereby optimizing\nthe fuzzing process. We evaluate CureFuzz on various SDMs and experimental\nresults demonstrate that CureFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a\nsubstantial margin in the total number of faults and distinct types of\ncrash-triggering scenarios.

However, numerous\naccident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex\nscenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for\nidentifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,\nreal-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more\ntargeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on\nvisual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,\nsince existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,\nOpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and\nADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in\nOpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM\nto convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario\nfiles. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario\ndisassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the\nderivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps\ndevelopers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors\nof ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file\ntrees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source\nADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts\ntextual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity\nthrough mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in\nterms of safety, smartness, and smoothness."}

Unlike conventional systems that rely on human operators, these\nfunctions require new assessment frameworks to demonstrate that they do not\nintroduce unacceptable risks under real-world conditions. To make a convincing\nsafety claim, the developer must present a thorough justification argument,\nsupported by evidence, that a function is free from unreasonable risk when\noperated in its intended context. The key concept relevant to the presented\nwork is the intended context, often captured by an Operational Design Domain\nspecification (ODD).

Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches\nfor code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive\ninference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context\nlearning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional\nretrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,\nfail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal\nretrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a\nfine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for\naccurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search\nspace using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular\ndual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,\nenabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.\nFurthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from\nreal-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of\nsynthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on\nRACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode\nachieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,\nhighlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios."}
