Moreover, our programming model, Timetide, alleviates the need\nfor physical clock synchronisation by building on the recently proposed logical\nsynchrony model for distributed systems. We discuss the important aspects of\ndistributing computation, such as network communication delays, and explore the\nformal verification of Timetide programs.

Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about\ndiverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the\ndependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between\nagents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via\nmultiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic\nwith Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators\nthat enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming\nor outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given\nproperty of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense\nat least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to\ncollaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for\nindividual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not\nan STL-GO specification is satisfied.

For more complex data sharing scenarios,\nwhere consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a\ncontract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within\nthe contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations\nassociated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a\nmeans to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal\nobligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG)\nadoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics,\nallows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants\nnegotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that\nCCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool\n(ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in\nthe Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool\nreports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying\nand ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism,\nsuch as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We\nsemi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies,\nwhich automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish\ndata consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract\nlifecycle data. We have implemented the approach, integrated it into ACT and\ntested its correctness and performance against basic CCV consistency\nrequirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548cSHACL\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbGDPR\u5408\u540c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177ACT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177ACT\u5728GDPR\u5408\u540c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548cSHACL\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230ACT\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ACT\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u7ba1\u7406GDPR\u5408\u89c4\u5408\u540c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

The semantics of BPPLs are usually mathematically complex and\nunable to reason about desirable properties such as expected values and\nindependence of random variables. To reason about these properties in a\nnon-Bayesian setting, probabilistic separation logics such as PSL and Lilac\ninterpret separating conjunction as probabilistic independence of random\nvariables. However, no existing separation logic can handle Bayesian updating,\nwhich is the key distinguishing feature of BPPLs.\n  To close this gap, we introduce Bayesian separation logic (BaSL), a\nprobabilistic separation logic that gives semantics to BPPL. We prove an\ninternal version of Bayes' theorem using a result in measure theory known as\nthe Rokhlin-Simmons disintegration theorem. Consequently, BaSL can model\nprobabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised\ndistribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and\nimproper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of\nBaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via\n$\\sigma$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of\nHoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL\nbased on the category of $s$-finite kernels.

Writing specifications correctly, however, remains\nparticularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known\nlanguage Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write\ncomplete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English).\nTwo, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with\nrespect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of\nAlloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy\nexpressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent\nthe desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the\nexperimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ\ntwo popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show\nthat the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas\nfrom input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to\nenumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at\ncompleting given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language\ndescriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases).

Objectives: We hypothesize that developers'\ninteractions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and\ncognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect\ntechnology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a\nmixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a\ncounterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks\n(medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only\ninternet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate\norder effects.

Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like\nGherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal\nlogic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces\nRequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds\ncausal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture.\nRequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically,\nclearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior\nrequirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited\nrequirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions\nand behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and\noptimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin\nrequirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user\nnarratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and\nconducted extensive experiments.

This paper\nintroduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents\noperate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading\nagents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across\n61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented\nempirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.\n  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software\nengineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in\nbenchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI\ngovernance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review\ntimelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond\nsynthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often\noutperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a\ntrust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code\nsubmission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in\nthree years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).\n  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for\nthe SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev\nenables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports\nbuilding the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks,\nresearchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models\nas test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug\ndetection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical\nlimitations: Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's\noperator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator\ncombinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods\nneglect measuring model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous\nmodels potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time.\nThirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model\nmeasurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without\nconsidering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM,\nthe first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model\nmeasurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve\ntheir trade-off.

Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting\nthree-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we\nleverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein\nsequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In\nparticular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token\nsequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's\nsequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline\nof AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code\nfragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA\nfrom lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse\ndatasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming\nlanguages.

Given a software\nproject with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow\nof an input from an externally accessible API (\"source\") to the \"sink\"\ncorresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an\ninput must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along\nthe flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a\nfeedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or\ndynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming\nlanguages.\n  To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100\nknown vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine\nis able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct\n2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine\nrepresents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings\nsuggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents\non PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging.

The contributions also include: a detailed\nmethodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other\nprojects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible\nby the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs,\nwith 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs\nfor debugging and Automatic Program Repair.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5206\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e00\u7ec4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4f7f\u7528LLM\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7ec4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Goal-Query-Metric\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u5728\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76847\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u548cLLM\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, no similar studies have\nbeen conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science.\n  To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we\n(1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during\ndevelopment time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to\na data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers\nwith different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655\ncells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the\ndynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take\nplace in the notebooks.\n  In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the\ncells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes\nwere relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications.
