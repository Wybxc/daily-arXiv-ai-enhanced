These rewrites optimize tensor computational graphs with the expectation of preserving semantics for tensors of arbitrary rank and size. Despite this expectation, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a fully automated verification system to prove the soundness of these rewrites for tensors of arbitrary rank and size. Previous works, while successful in verifying rewrites with tensors of concrete rank, do not provide guarantees in the unbounded setting.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce TensorRight, the first automatic verification system that can verify tensor graph rewrites for input tensors of arbitrary rank and size. We introduce a core language, TensorRight DSL, to represent rewrite rules using a novel axis definition, called aggregated-axis, which allows us to reason about an unbounded number of axes. We achieve unbounded verification by proving that there exists a bound on tensor ranks, under which bounded verification of all instances implies the correctness of the rewrite rule in the unbounded setting. We derive an algorithm to compute this rank using the denotational semantics of TensorRight DSL. TensorRight employs this algorithm to generate a finite number of bounded-verification proof obligations, which are then dispatched to an SMT solver using symbolic execution to automatically verify the correctness of the rewrite rules. We evaluate TensorRight's verification capabilities by implementing rewrite rules present in XLA's algebraic simplifier. The results demonstrate that TensorRight can prove the correctness of 115 out of 175 rules in their full generality, while the closest automatic, bounded-verification system can express only 18 of these rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "TensorRight\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u5f20\u91cf\u56fe\u91cd\u5199\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u805a\u5408\u8f74\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u754c\u5f20\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u91cd\u5199\u89c4\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5177\u4f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TensorRight DSL\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u5408\u8f74\u5b9a\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u6709\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u548cSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728XLA\u4ee3\u6570\u7b80\u5316\u5668\u7684175\u4e2a\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\uff0cTensorRight\u80fd\u8bc1\u660e115\u4e2a\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6709\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe18\u4e2a\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "TensorRight\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f20\u91cf\u56fe\u91cd\u5199\u89c4\u5219\u65e0\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f20\u91cf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator.

These are propagated through the satisfaction tree, supporting precise identification even in nested formulas. To improve efficiency, only the reachable sets contributing to uncertainty are refined, identified through the associated markers.

Quality in Requirements Engineering (RE) is still predominantly anecdotal and intuition-driven. Creating a solid requirements quality model requires broad sets of empirical evidence to evaluate quality factors and their context. Problem. However, empirical data on the detailed effects of requirements quality defects is scarce, since it is costly to obtain. Furthermore, with the advent of AI-based development, the requirements quality factors may change: Requirements are no longer only consumed by humans, but increasingly also by AI agents, which might lead to a different efficient and effective requirements style. Principal ideas. We propose to extend the RE research toolbox with Agentic AI simulations, in which software engineering (SE) processes are replicated by standardized agents in stochastic, dynamic, event-driven, qualitative simulations. We argue that their speed and simplicity makes them a valuable addition to RE research, although limitations in replicating human behavior need to be studied and understood. Contribution.

A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6807\u8bb0\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684Cantor-Kantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6298\u73b0\u548c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u62bd\u8c61\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6298\u73b0\u548c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eCK\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f#P\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u754cCK\u8ddd\u79bb\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6709\u754c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aCK\u8ddd\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u540c\u6837\u662f#P\u96be\u7684\u3002"}}

Also, it is essential to support system evolution, service interoperability, and governance across organizational boundaries to ensure good quality and consistency of these APIs. However, evaluating API design quality, which is part of non-functional requirement tasks, remains a largely manual and ad hoc process, particularly during early development. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, we elicited user needs, identified 75 API design rules using a literature review, and implemented a configurable rule engine to detect structural violations in OpenAPI specifications. The proposed tool supports organizational adaptability by allowing rules to be customized, enabled, or disabled, enabling integration of domain-specific standards. The evaluation was conducted through structured experiments and thematic analysis involving industry experts. API quality validation contributes to aligning technical designs with requirements and enterprise architecture by strengthening interoperability and governance between enterprise systems. The results show that S.E.O.R.A facilitates early validation of non-functional API requirements, provides actionable and traceable feedback, and aligns well with requirements elicitation and quality assurance processes. It improves the API design process by automating checks that would otherwise require manual inspection, thus supporting consistent and reusable conformance practices. This work contributes to requirements engineering by operationalizing design principles as verifiable constraints and embedding them into a practical validation tool. Future directions include IDE integration, expanded rule coverage, and real-world deployment to support continuous compliance in agile API development lifecycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u64ce\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bOpenAPI\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u652f\u6301API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6539\u5584API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "RESTful API\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u624b\u52a8\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u8fdb\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8675\u4e2aAPI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u64ce\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bOpenAPI\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aS.E.O.R.A\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u65e9\u671f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027API\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e0e\u9700\u6c42\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u826f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e86\u539f\u672c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u5305\u62ecIDE\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5219\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u654f\u6377API\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

This view originates in work by de Queiroz and collaborators and yields a weak groupoid structure for equality, together with a computational account of homotopy inspired by homotopy type theory. In this paper we present a complete mechanization of this framework in Lean 4 and show how it supports concrete homotopy theoretic computations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formalize the theory of computational paths in Lean, including path formation, composition, inverses, and a rewrite system that identifies redundant or trivial paths. We prove that equality types with computational paths carry a weak groupoid structure in the sense of the original theory. Second, we organize this material into a reusable Lean library, ComputationalPathsLean, which exposes an interface for paths, rewrites, and loop spaces. This library allows later developments to treat computational paths as a drop-in replacement for propositional equality when reasoning about homotopical structure. Third, we apply the library to two canonical examples in algebraic topology. We give Lean proofs that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers and that the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the product of two copies of the integers, both via computational paths. These case studies demonstrate that the computational paths approach scales to nontrivial homotopical computations in a modern proof assistant.

The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.\n  We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.\n  Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing.

However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch. It then applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting to refine only these localized tokens, enabling targeted and fine-grained correction. To further stabilize the iterative repair loop, TokenRepair incorporates a quality-aware external feedback mechanism that evaluates patch quality and filters out low-quality candidates before refinement. Experimental results show that TokenRepair achieves new state-of-the-art repair performance, correctly fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, demonstrating substantial improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% across all models on Defects4J 1.2 and from 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenRepair\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5982\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63ed\u793a\u8865\u4e01\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u6216\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "TokenRepair\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u6765\u6267\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u7591\u6216\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u6765\u4ec5\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u4e01\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5728\u7ec6\u5316\u524d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aTokenRepair\u5728Defects4J 1.2\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u4fee\u590d\u4e8688\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728HumanEval-Java\u4e0a\u4fee\u590d\u4e86139\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728Defects4J 1.2\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.2%\u523034.9%\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728HumanEval-Java\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.3%\u523016.1%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenRepair\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM-based APR\u6548\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance.

Regulatory frameworks such as UN regulations, NCAP standards, ISO norms, and NHTSA guidelines impose strict bounds on system reaction times to ensure safe vehicle operation. This paper presents a structured, White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling to address these timing challenges. Unlike Black-Box approaches, Event-Chain Analysis offers transparent insights into the timing behavior of each functional component - from perception and planning to actuation and human interaction. This perspective is also aligned with multiple regulations, which require that homologation dossiers provide evidence that the chosen system architecture is suitable to ensure compliance with the specified requirements. Our methodology enables the derivation, modeling, and validation of end-to-end timing constraints at the architectural level and facilitates early verification through simulation. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate how this Event-Chain-centric approach enhances regulatory compliance, optimizes system design, and supports model-based safety analysis techniques, with results showing early identification of compliance issues, systematic parameter optimization, and quantitative evidence generation through probabilistic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u5230\u6267\u884c\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Our empirical study of GitHub repositories revealed that 47% of release artifacts lacked traceability links, and 12% contained broken links. To address this gap, we first analyzed release notes to identify their What, Why, and How information and assessed how these align with PRs, commits, and issues. We curated a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,500 filtered and validated traceability link instances. Then, we implemented LLM-based approaches to automatically establish traceability links of three pairs between release note contents & PRs, release note contents & PRs and release note contents & issues. By combining the time proximity feature, the LLM-based approach, e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved a high Precision@1 value of 0.73 for PR traceability recovery.

Software engineering has advanced significantly in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reliability of LLMs in software engineering is often compromised by ambiguities and inconsistencies due to improper user specification. To address this challenge, we present CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a metamorphic relation-driven LLM agent that systematically refines task specifications and generates semantically constrained test cases. Our proposed framework uses MRs with LLMs to improve generation consistency and reduce variability caused by specifications, unlike the traditional use of MRs as post validations.

However, several limitations hinder symbolic execution from application on real-world software. One of the limitations is the inability to solve diverse execution path constraints: traditional symbolic execution based on SMT solvers is difficult to handle execution paths with complex data structures or external API calls. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibility of adopting large language models (LLM) for path constraint solving instead of traditional solver-based techniques in symbolic execution. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the ability of LLMs in two types of path constraint solving: generating test inputs to facilitate an execution path, and determining whether a given execution path can be satisfied without triggering any bugs. We build new evaluation pipelines and benchmarks for two tasks: test case generation and path classification, which include data sources from both competition-level programs and real-world repositories. Our experiment results show that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve path constraints in both generation and classification tasks, with 60% of generated test cases that accurately cover the given execution path. Moreover, LLMs are capable of improving test coverage by covering execution paths in real-world repositories where traditional symbolic execution tools cannot be applied. These findings highlight the possibility of extending symbolic execution techniques with LLMs in the future to improve the ability and generalizability of symbolic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5916\u90e8API\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5224\u65ad\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u800c\u4e0d\u89e6\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c60%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8986\u76d6\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002LLM\u80fd\u591f\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7528LLM\u6269\u5c55\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TreeRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u4ef6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u6811\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cLLM\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u4ef6\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6784\u4ef6\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6784\u4ef6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTreeRec\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efaIntentRecBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u6784\u4ef6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u6811\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTreeRec\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeRec\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6784\u4ef6\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u4ef6\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation.

Existing automated logging tools often overlook the fundamental whether-to-log decision and struggle with the composite nature of logging. In this paper, we propose Autologger, a novel hybrid framework that addresses the complete the end-to-end logging pipeline. Autologger first employs a fine-tuned classifier, the Judger, to accurately determine if a method requires new logging statements. If logging is needed, a multi-agent system is activated. The system includes specialized agents: a Locator dedicated to determining where to log, and a Generator focused on what to log. These agents work together, utilizing our designed program analysis and retrieval tools. We evaluate Autologger on a large corpus from three mature open-source projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that Autologger achieves 96.63\\% F1-score on the crucial whether-to-log decision. In an end-to-end setting, Autologger improves the overall quality of generated logging statements by 16.13\\% over the strongest baseline, as measured by an LLM-as-a-judge score.

With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid. To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports. We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports. While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports. To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias. We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report. Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.\n  Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67909,942\u4efd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8d4f\u91d1\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u730e\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u62a5\u544a\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c69,942\u4efd\u5df2\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8d4f\u91d1\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30GPT-5\u3001DeepSeek\u548c\u5fae\u8c03RoBERTa\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u6848\u4f8b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a5\u53d7\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002"}}

Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a personalized solution to enhance user experience, yet barriers to adoption remain. Understanding user preferences and trade-offs is essential to ensure widespread acceptance of adaptation designs. This study identifies key factors influencing user preferences and trade-offs in mHealth adaptation design. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted with 186 participants who have chronic diseases and use mHealth applications. Participants were asked to select preferred adaptation designs from choices featuring six attributes with varying levels. A mixed logit model was used to analyze preference heterogeneity and determine the factors most likely influencing adoption. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to explore differences by age, gender, health conditions, and coping mechanisms. Maintaining usability while ensuring controllability over adaptations, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes are key factors that facilitate the adoption of adaptive mHealth app designs. In contrast, frequently used functions and caregiver involvement can diminish the perceived value of such adaptations. This study employs a data-driven approach to quantify user preferences, identify key trade-offs, and reveal variations across demographic and behavioral subgroups through preference heterogeneity modeling.

Patients' needs evolve dynamically with their health progression, adherence, and caregiver support, creating unique requirements engineering (RE) challenges that traditional approaches often overlook. This study introduces ChroniUXMag, a framework for eliciting and analysing inclusivity requirements in mHealth design. Building on InclusiveMag and GenderMag principles, the framework aims to help researchers and practitioners systematically capture and evaluate factors that influence how individuals with chronic conditions perceive, trust, and interact with mHealth systems. The framework was developed through two stages of the InclusiveMag process. In the first stage, inclusivity facets were identified through a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews, and a large-scale survey. In the second stage, these facets were synthesised into personas representing diverse health situations, attitudes, and digital practices, and integrated into an adapted cognitive walkthrough form. Thirteen facets were identified that capture the socio-technical complexity of mHealth use, including trust, digital literacy, dependency, and cultural context.

These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent.

Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs.

Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field.

Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical. However, existing approaches have limitations in testing optimization stages, which is the core functionality of DL compilers, due to the difficulty in generating optimization-aware tests. In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-aware computational graphs. The approach combines patterns extracted from documented tests for optimization and incorporates them into seed computational graphs, enabling broader exploration of optimization paths. To guarantee the optimization-awareness of generated graphs, OATest introduces the edges reusing strategy to establish strong connections between patterns and contexts. Additionally, to solve the validity challenge for the generated graphs, OATest employs an auxiliary layers addition strategy to resolve broken constraints. Equipped with two distinct test oracles, OATest applies differential testing to evaluate the two widely used DL compilers (i.e., TVM and ONNXRuntime). Our experimental results show that OATest outperforms the state-of-the-art method by detecting more bugs and achieving higher code coverage in TVM and ONNXRutimes.

However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques.\n  To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps.

A Systematic Evaluation with Symbolic Execution", "comment": null, "summary": "Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u548cLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u6362\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-4.1-mini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u52a0\u5165KLEE\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4ef6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6dc6\u7ed9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548cLLM\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u8c13\u8bcd\u3001\u7b97\u672f\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u7684C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u6dc6/\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u5165KLEE\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4ef6\uff08SMT\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "GPT-4.1-mini\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u53cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u52a0\u5165KLEE\u5de5\u4ef6\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u662f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u5b58\u5728\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time. The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper. To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated. Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively. To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study.

Given a set of specifications, our technique generates a suite of test cases that, once classified by the user as desirable or not, narrows down the set of candidates to at most one specification. Two alternative solver-based algorithms are proposed, one that generates a minimal test suite, and another that does not ensure minimality. Both algorithms were implemented in a prototype that can be used generate test suites to help choose among alternative Alloy specifications. Our evaluation of this prototype against a large set of problems showed that the optimal algorithm is efficient enough for many practical problems, and that the non-optimal algorithm can scale up to dozens of candidate specifications while still generating reasonably sized test suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5c0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u4f46\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u5728\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eAlloy\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u5019\u9009\u89c4\u8303\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MTP\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u7eaf\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u91ca\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230Jac\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55MTP\u4ee5\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e3aAI\u96c6\u6210\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u3002"}}
