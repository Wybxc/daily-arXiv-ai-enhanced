This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch\nrevision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any\nindividual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined\nsub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific\nsub-tasks.

Since distributed algorithms are often designed to cope with\nfaults, a first step towards using session types to verify distributed\nalgorithms is to integrate fault-tolerance.\n  We extend FTMPST (a version of fault-tolerant multiparty session types with\nfailure patterns to represent system requirements for system failures such as\nunreliable communication and process crashes) by a novel, fault-tolerant loop\nconstruct with global escapes that does not require global coordination. Each\nprocess runs its own local version of the loop. If a process finds a solution\nto the considered problem, it does not only terminate its own loop but also\ninforms the other participants via exit-messages.

To increase\nefficiency and model standard fault-tolerant algorithms, these messages are\nnon-blocking, i.e., a process may continue until a possibly delayed\nexit-message is received.

PRDBench features rich data\nsources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an\nAgent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of\nvarious test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents\nand evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation\nand evaluation."}

This surge has exposed a critical\nbottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.\nHuman evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated\nmetrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the\nLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.\nThis approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward\nhuman-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is\nstill in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the\ncommunity toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software\nartifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their\nlimitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We\nenvision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates\ncapable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims\nto foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately\nimproving the scalability of software artifact evaluation."}

While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for\nfunction-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where\ncapturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We\nintroduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic\nrepository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki\nemploys three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves\narchitectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic\ndelegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including\narchitecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first\nrepository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic\nassessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and\n64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source\nsystems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world\nrepositories."}

Me, Andrian Marcus, Takashi Kobayashi and Shinpei Hayashi were\ngeneral chairs, Nicole Novielli, Kevin Moran, Yutaro Kashiwa and Masanari Kondo\nwere program chairs, some members of my group, Carmen Armenti, Stefano\nCampanella, Roberto Minelli, were the tables, can't have a room with only\nchairs, after all. We invited a crowd of people to discuss what future software\nengineering has. FUSE became a 3-day marathon on whether there is actually a\nfuture at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at\nthat event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some\nhealthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to\nrun out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where\nwe're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software\nmakers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field\nmoving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying\nlike rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software\nengineering looks like a car crash in slow motion: you can see it coming but\nyou can't look away. The thing is..."}
