The higher the score, the\nmore difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a\nframework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a\nmicroservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs\n(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do\nvery poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate\nbusiness logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and\ninclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication.

In this work,\nwe address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with\nuser-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages\nlike Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we\nextend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By\ntranslating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static\nanalysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in\nthe program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly\ndefined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network\nfactorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a\nnovel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of\nrandom variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound\nprogram slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three\nwell-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the\nvariance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both\nsingle-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo.

In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving.
