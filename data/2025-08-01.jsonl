A popular method to address such task is shielding, in which a\ncorrect-by-construction safety component is synthesized from logical\nspecifications. Recently, shield synthesis has been extended to infinite-state\ndomains, such as continuous environments. This makes shielding more applicable\nto realistic scenarios. However, often shields might be unrealizable because\nthe specification is inconsistent (e.g., contradictory). In order to address\nthis gap, we present a method to obtain simple unconditional and conditional\nexplanations that witness unrealizability, which goes by temporal formula\nunrolling.

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the\nmanagement of a centralized platform is an essential requirement.

Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code\ngeneration. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it\nfirst generates device control logic by progressively retrieving\ndevice-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code\nusing platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a\nmulti-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT\ndevice testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires\nonly binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We\nevaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT\nplatforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average\nsuccess rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any\nhuman involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code\nis then revised to reach 100% function coverage.
