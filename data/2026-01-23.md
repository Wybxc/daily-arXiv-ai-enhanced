### [1] [Remarks on Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15455)
*Patrycja Balik,Szymon Jędras,Piotr Polesiuk*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文指出Jouvelot和Gifford1991年开创性论文《Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects》中类型和效应重建算法存在与高阶多态性相关的变量绑定bug。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Jouvelot和Gifford的1991年论文被认为是类型和效应系统的里程碑工作，但其原始算法考虑了具有高阶多态性的语言，这一特性难以正确实现。本文旨在识别该算法在处理这一特性时存在的微妙bug。

Method: 重新审视Jouvelot和Gifford的类型系统和重建算法，分析其处理高阶多态性的方法，识别变量绑定相关的细微问题。

Result: 发现了原始算法中与变量绑定相关的微妙bug，这些bug源于对高阶多态性处理的不足。

Conclusion: 尽管Jouvelot和Gifford的开创性工作为类型和效应系统奠定了基础，但其原始算法在高阶多态性实现方面存在缺陷，需要修正以确保正确性。

Abstract: In their 1991 paper "Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects," Pierre Jouvelot and David Gifford presented a type-and-effect reconstruction algorithm based on an algebraic structure of effects. Their work is considered a milestone in the development of type-and-effect systems, and has inspired numerous subsequent works in the area of static analysis. However, unlike the later research it spawned, the original algorithm considered a language with higher-rank polymorphism, a feature which is challenging to implement correctly. In this note, we identify subtle bugs related to variable binding in their approach to this feature. We revisit their type system and reconstruction algorithm, and describe the discovered issues.

### [2] [Prioritizing Configuration Relevance via Compiler-Based Refined Feature Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16008)
*Federico Bruzzone,Walter Cazzola,Luca Favini*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出首个基于编译器的Rust配置优先级排序方法，通过图中心性度量对特征排序，生成有限数量的相关配置，解决配置组合爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代编程语言（特别是Rust）通过特征聚合构建高度可配置系统，但配置组合爆炸使程序分析、优化和测试的穷举探索不可行，需要优先排序配置。

Method: 四步法：1.从Rust编译器提取定制中间表示；2.构建两种互补的图数据结构；3.使用中心性度量对特征排序；4.考虑代码影响范围细化排序。基于特征排序生成固定数量的相关配置，使用SAT求解器保证配置有效性。

Result: 在开源Rust项目上的实证评估表明，RustyEx原型能在有限资源内高效生成用户指定的配置集，同时通过构造保证正确性。中心性引导的配置优先级排序能有效实用地探索大型配置空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为配置感知分析和优化开辟了新途径，证明了基于编译器的配置优先级排序在实践中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Modern programming languages, most notably Rust, offer advanced linguistic constructs for building highly configurable software systems as aggregation of features -- identified by a configuration. However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.
